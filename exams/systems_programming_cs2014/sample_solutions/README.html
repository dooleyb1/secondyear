<h1>CS2014 2017/2018 sample exam paper and associated code</h1>
<p>This is an example exam paper for my course on systems 
programming (<a href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014">CS2014</a>),
the canonical URL for this is 
<a href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014/sample-exam/README.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Files in this example:</h2>
<ul>
<li>README.md - this file in markdown format</li>
<li>README.html - this file, in HTML format (<code>'make html'</code> to update that from .md)</li>
<li><a href="Makefile">Makefile</a> - to build the sample answer code and HTML (there's a clean target too)</li>

</ul>
<p>After running <code>'make'</code> then these files will be produced (if all
goes well):</p>
<ul>
<li>README.html - the html version of README.md</li>
<li>dnsparse - a question 1 binary</li>
<li>mainfsize - a question 2 binary</li>
<li>mainfsize_pp - a question 2 binary</li>
<li>mainfsize.o - a question 2 object file</li>
<li>mainfsize_pp.o - a question 2 object file</li>
<li>fsize.o - a question 2 object file</li>
<li>badcat - a bad, crashy binary for question 3 </li>
<li>middlingbad - a less bad non-crashy program for question 3</li>
<li>lessbadcat - an even less bad non-crashy program for question 3</li>
</ul>
<h1>Question 1 notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>I wrote the code there in "real time" so I'm pretty sure it's buggy, in particular 
  there's likely an off-by-one error if a label of length 63 is encoutered.
  (You can criticise that code as an exercise if you like - send a pull
  request!)</li>
<li>If you suspect issues like the above, it's ok to add notes around your answer.</li>
<li>As you can see the mapping from the quesion to the code is fairly, but not
  entirely, obvious. I <em>strongly</em> recommend you use a workbook to write out
  initial code and then try tidy that up later. Do include all such rough
  work of course - it'll get marks if it contains anything of use.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Question 2 notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>For part (b) - you should describe the typical edit, compile, test
  cycle - for such descriptions, I only need (but do need) enough
  detail to show you understand what you're doing - you do not need
  to include exhaustive detail nor be overly precise.</li>
<li>I haven't coded up 'enhancements' - pull requests are welcome!</li>
</ul>
<h1>Question 3 notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>There're lots more than 5 flaws in that code! (Oddly, I did find it
  on the net, and used almost exactly what I found - be careful using
  random code!)</li>
<li>Check out the diff files for the kinds of flaws to talk about for
  part (a) - I assume that's fairly obvious.</li>
<li>For part (b), I chose to try keep the new code comparable to the
  old code, just to make those diffs useful. You don't need to do 
  that in your answer.</li>
<li>For part (c), I'd like you to show me that you know how to test
  a program like this - I don't need the fully theory of fuzzing,
  but would like you to provide your general appraoch and a few
  examples of things you'd test (less obvious ones are better).</li>
</ul>
