<h1>C Program Examples#2</h1>
<p>These are some C program examples from my course on systems 
programming (<a href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014">CS2014</a>),
the canonical URL for this is 
<a href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014/examples/c-progs-2/README.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Files in this example:</h2>
<ul>
<li>README.md - this file in markdown format</li>
<li>README.html - this file, in HTML format (<code>'make html'</code> to update that from .md)</li>
<li><a href="Makefile">Makefile</a> - to build the example and HTML (there's a clean target too)</li>
<li><a href="refman.pdf">refman.pdf</a> - doxygen automated documentation from javadoc comments</li>
<li><a href="rnd-dox">rnd-dox</a> - doxygen config file</li>
<li><a href="rndbytes.c">rndbytes.c</a> - a couple of wee utility fuctions to get stuff from <code>/dev/random</code></li>
<li><a href="rndbytes.h">rndbytes.h</a> - header for those functions</li>
<li><a href="rbtest.c">rbtest.c</a> - <code>main()</code> that calls functions from <code>rndbytes.h</code></li>
<li><a href="rnd-options.c">rnd-options.c</a> - shows different options for API</li>
</ul>
<p>After running <code>'make'</code> then these files will be produced (if all
goes well):</p>
<ul>
<li>README.html - the html version of README.md</li>
<li>rndbytes.o - the rndbytes object file</li>
<li>rbtest - the rndbytes test program</li>
<li>rnd-options - built as you like it:-)</li>
</ul>
<h2>A More Structured <code>rndbytes.c</code> setup</h2>
<p>This iteration of the <code>rndbytes</code> example demonstrates a bunch of 
things that we'll talk about in class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making a header file</li>
<li>Object files and the build</li>
<li>Documentation (via doxygen, not sure how relevant, but leads to useful thoughts)</li>
<li>Coding styles such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Coding_Style">Mozilla's</a></li>
<li>Performance (running <code>time c-prog-2/rbtest 60000</code> vs. <code>time c-prog-1/rndbytes 60000</code>) </li>
</ul>
<h2>The header file or the API prototypes</h2>
<p>Today, the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">Application Progamming
Interface</a>
(API) is a bit ambiguous as to whether we're talking about the kind of API in
question here, or a web API that one accesses over the Internet via HTTPS. For
this course we mean the former, except as otherwise stated. Normally,
that'd be the reverse.</p>

<h2>Documentation/Comments and all that...</h2>
<p>There are varying opinions as to whether and how to best document
your code. Those vary from "don't include any comments" to schemes
for generating code from "documentation." [refs needed]</p>
<p>A lot of the "debate" on this topic seems pertty badly justified
to me, and more like a whole load of opinion. However, there are
some aspects of documentation on which I think a lot of people
would agree:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In most development environments, you will in any case have to
follow the local coding style, so you won't get to choose, until
you're the one writing the coding style (which takes us beyond this
course:-). In other words, usually there's no point in worrying
about this as you'll have no choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding <a href="https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html">Javadoc</a> 
style comments to APIs is a fine thing. Those do make it easier
to understand an API, and also force you to think a bit more when
creating an API, and automatically produced documentation is a
fine thing, since it saves you time. 
There's a <a href="https://www.narf.ssji.net/~shtrom/wiki/tips/doxygencheatsheet">cheatsheet</a>
for doxygen here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>usage()</code> and help options for command line tools are good, 
as is a man page, if you might want your tool to be adopted
by e.g. some Linux distro. If it's just a local tool and not aiming
to be part of an open-source distro, then you can probably skip 
the man page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will inevitably need to leave TODO: and FIXME: breadcrumbs,
for yourself or later developers. Those are good things if they
help someone to later debug a problem! But it's clearly a bad
practice to just leave your code incomplete and think a FIXME:
is sufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding comments, but especially keeping comments up to date, 
takes time, and you probably won't have that much time (or will 
get bored), so having too many comments does have negative 
consequences. In the worst case, if code is changed but
comments aren't then comments might be misleading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are cases where some fragment of code is just complex
or non-obvious and really needs some documentation to explain what's
going on. In-line code comments can be a good way to do that,
as you will see those when you look at the code, but might
not see any other artefact. (Unless comments have been 
stripped.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making your code as "self-documenting" as you can is good. 
Choose meaningful names for functions and variables, but
it's also ok to just use <code>foo</code> or <code>i</code>. Do consider
what someone reading your code might think, as you 
write (and re-factor) your code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall goal should be to make your code something that can
be understood, fixed or refactored by you or someone else, 
possibly in many years time.</p>
<p>While Javascript code is often minimised (to save transmission
and speed up download) there aren't that often equivalent 
benefits for systems programming code where maintainability
is often more important.</p>
<h2>The implementation of the API</h2>
<p>Here's the modest snippet of code that implements the API:</p>
<pre><code>    /*!
     * @file rndbytes.c
     * @brief This is the implementation of the external i/f for the rndbytes example

<p>Noteworthy things:</p>
<ul>
<li>including the corresponding header file isn't needed by helps with errors as you edit code </li>
<li><code>rndbytes()</code> function memory management</li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative function could have been:</p>
<pre><code>    int rndbytes(unsigned char** bufp,int buflen)
    {
        if (!bufp) return(1);
        unsigned char *buf=malloc(buflen);
        if (!buf) return(1);
        syscall(SYS_getrandom, buf, buflen, 0);
        *bufp=buf;
        return(0);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Or even...</p>
<pre><code>    unsigned char *rndbytes(int buflen)
    {
        unsigned char *buf=malloc(buflen);
        if (!buf) return(NULL);
        syscall(SYS_getrandom, buf, buflen, 0);
        return(buf);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Both are more error prone - why?</p>
<p>See <a href="rnd-options.c"><code>rnd-options.c</code></a> for different 
options that you can conditionally compile.</p>
