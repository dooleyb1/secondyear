<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This example has my favourite line of code ever! I first wrote (a
version of) this in the mid-1990's. It purpose is to break things, 
for good.</p>
<p>The context was that I was working in a large-ish software development
team on a large codebase (maybe 10^6 LOC) where that code has lots of
calls to <code>malloc()</code>, and we suspected (knew actually:-) that not all bits 
of calling code checked the return value from <code>malloc()</code>.</p>
<h2>The Core Line of Code</h2>
<p>The LOC itself:</p>
<pre><code>    #define malloc(__xxx__) (rand()%100&lt;=30?0:malloc((__xxx__)))
</code></pre>
<p>What does that do?</p>
<hr />
<h2>First, some man pages...</h2>
<p>So, what is <code>malloc()</code>? Let's use the unix/linux manual pages to find out... </p>
<pre><code>    $ man malloc
</code></pre>
<p>That produces this information...</p>

MALLOC(3)                                           Linux Programmer's Manual                                           MALLOC(3)

NAME
       malloc, free, calloc, realloc - allocate and free dynamic memory

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltstdlib.h>

       void *malloc(size_t size);
       void free(void *ptr);
       void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);
       void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);

DESCRIPTION
       The  malloc() function allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.  The memory is not initialized.
       If size is 0, then malloc() returns either NULL, or a unique pointer value  that  can  later  be  successfully  passed  to
       free().

       The  free()  function  frees  the memory space pointed to by ptr, which must have been returned by a previous call to mal-
       loc(), calloc(), or realloc().  Otherwise, or if free(ptr) has already been called before, undefined behavior occurs.   If
       ptr is NULL, no operation is performed.

       The  calloc()  function  allocates  memory  for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each and returns a pointer to the
       allocated memory.  The memory is set to zero.  If nmemb or size is 0, then calloc()  returns  either  NULL,  or  a  unique
       pointer value that can later be successfully passed to free().

       The  realloc()  function  changes  the  size  of  the  memory block pointed to by ptr to size bytes.  The contents will be
       unchanged in the range from the start of the region up to the minimum of the old and new sizes.  If the new size is larger
       than the old size, the added memory will not be initialized.  If ptr is NULL, then the call is equivalent to malloc(size),
       for all values of size; if size is equal to zero, and ptr is not NULL, then the call is equivalent to  free(ptr).   Unless
       ptr is NULL, it must have been returned by an earlier call to malloc(), calloc() or realloc().  If the area pointed to was
       moved, a free(ptr) is done.

RETURN VALUE
       The malloc() and calloc() functions return a pointer to the allocated memory, which is suitably aligned for  any  built-in
       type.   On  error, these functions return NULL.  NULL may also be returned by a successful call to malloc() with a size of
       zero, or by a successful call to calloc() with nmemb or size equal to zero.

       The free() function returns no value.

       The realloc() function returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory, which is suitably aligned for  any  built-in  type
       and may be different from ptr, or NULL if the request fails.  If size was equal to 0, either NULL or a pointer suitable to
       be passed to free() is returned.  If realloc() fails, the original block is left untouched; it is not freed or moved.

ERRORS
       calloc(), malloc(), and realloc() can fail with the following error:

       ENOMEM Out of memory.  Possibly, the application hit the RLIMIT_AS or RLIMIT_DATA limit described in getrlimit(2).

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C89, C99.

NOTES
       By default, Linux follows an optimistic memory allocation strategy.  This means that when malloc() returns non-NULL  there
       is  no  guarantee that the memory really is available.  In case it turns out that the system is out of memory, one or more
       processes will be killed by the OOM killer.  For more information, see the description  of  /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
       and /proc/sys/vm/oom_adj in proc(5), and the Linux kernel source file Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting.

       Normally,  malloc()  allocates  memory  from  the heap, and adjusts the size of the heap as required, using sbrk(2).  When
       allocating blocks of memory larger than MMAP_THRESHOLD bytes, the glibc malloc() implementation allocates the memory as  a
       private  anonymous mapping using mmap(2).  MMAP_THRESHOLD is 128 kB by default, but is adjustable using mallopt(3).  Allo-
       cations performed using mmap(2) are unaffected by the RLIMIT_DATA resource limit (see getrlimit(2)).

       To avoid corruption in multithreaded applications, mutexes are used  internally  to  protect  the  memory-management  data
       structures  employed by these functions.  In a multithreaded application in which threads simultaneously allocate and free
       memory, there could be contention for these mutexes.  To scalably handle memory allocation in multithreaded  applications,
       glibc creates additional memory allocation arenas if mutex contention is detected.  Each arena is a large region of memory
       that is internally allocated by the system (using brk(2) or mmap(2)), and managed with its own mutexes.

       SUSv2 requires malloc(), calloc(), and realloc() to set errno to ENOMEM upon failure.  Glibc assumes  that  this  is  done
       (and  the  glibc  versions of these routines do this); if you use a private malloc implementation that does not set errno,
       then certain library routines may fail without having a reason in errno.

       Crashes in malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), or free() are almost always related to heap corruption, such as  overflowing  an
       allocated chunk or freeing the same pointer twice.

       The malloc() implementation is tunable via environment variables; see mallopt(3) for details.

<hr />
<p>Ok, I can kinda guess what rand() might be, but how to confirm?</p>
<p>Same plan. But note that <code>man rand</code> may not get you the right thing, (if you have openssl installed for example)
so you need to go for section 3 of the
manual pages, so we want <code>man 3 rand</code> in this case. There's a basic kind of search for topics that <code>man</code>
supports using the <code>-k</code> command line argument, so <code>man -k rand</code> will show us a list of the names
of man pages and in this case we want the one in section 3, which is for library calls.
You can of course find the same information via a web search (e.g. 
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=rand%20C%20function">https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=rand%20C%20function</a>)
but maybe you'll read the wrong thing, and there are system-specifics that can differ from 
OS to OS and even within different GNU/Linux distributions, so <code>man</code> is your best friend
even if not as usable as a web search.</p>

RAND(3)                                             Linux Programmer's Manual                                             RAND(3)

NAME
       rand, rand_r, srand - pseudo-random number generator

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltstdlib.h>

       int rand(void);

       int rand_r(unsigned int *seedp);

       void srand(unsigned int seed);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       rand_r(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  rand()  function  returns  a pseudo-random integer in the range 0 to RAND_MAX inclusive (i.e., the mathematical range
       [0, RAND_MAX]).

       The srand() function sets its argument as the seed for a new sequence of pseudo-random integers to be returned by  rand().
       These sequences are repeatable by calling srand() with the same seed value.

       If no seed value is provided, the rand() function is automatically seeded with a value of 1.

       The  function  rand()  is not reentrant, since it uses hidden state that is modified on each call.  This might just be the
       seed value to be used by the next call, or it might be something more elaborate.  In order to get reproducible behavior in
       a threaded application, this state must be made explicit; this can be done using the reentrant function rand_r().

       Like  rand(),  rand_r() returns a pseudo-random integer in the range [0, RAND_MAX].  The seedp argument is a pointer to an
       unsigned int that is used to store state between calls.  If rand_r() is called with the same initial value for the integer
       pointed to by seedp, and that value is not modified between calls, then the same pseudo-random sequence will result.

       The  value  pointed to by the seedp argument of rand_r() provides only a very small amount of state, so this function will
       be a weak pseudo-random generator.  Try drand48_r(3) instead.

RETURN VALUE
       The rand() and rand_r() functions return a value between 0 and RAND_MAX (inclusive).   The  srand()  function  returns  no
       value.

ATTRIBUTES
       For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see attributes(7).

CONFORMING TO
       The  functions  rand()  and  srand()  conform  to  SVr4,  4.3BSD,  C89,  C99, POSIX.1-2001.  The function rand_r() is from
       POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX.1-2008 marks rand_r() as obsolete.

NOTES
       The versions of rand() and srand() in the Linux C Library use the same random number  generator  as  random(3)  and  sran-
       dom(3),  so  the lower-order bits should be as random as the higher-order bits.  However, on older rand() implementations,
       and on current implementations on different systems, the lower-order bits are much less random than the higher-order bits.
       Do not use this function in applications intended to be portable when good randomness is needed.  (Use random(3) instead.)

EXAMPLE
       POSIX.1-2001  gives  the  following example of an implementation of rand() and srand(), possibly useful when one needs the
       same sequence on two different machines.

           static unsigned long next = 1;

           /* RAND_MAX assumed to be 32767 */
           int myrand(void) {
               next = next * 1103515245 + 12345;
               return((unsigned)(next/65536) % 32768);
           }

           void mysrand(unsigned int seed) {
               next = seed;
           }

       The following program can be used to display the pseudo-random sequence produced by rand() when given a particular seed.

           #include &ltstdlib.h>
           #include &ltstdio.h>

           int
           main(int argc, char *argv[])
           {
               int j, r, nloops;
               unsigned int seed;

               if (argc != 3) {
                   fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s &ltseed> &ltnloops>\n", argv[0]);
                   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
               }

               seed = atoi(argv[1]);
               nloops = atoi(argv[2]);

               srand(seed);
               for (j = 0; j &lt nloops; j++) {
                   r =  rand();
                   printf("%d\n", r);
               }

               exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
           }

</code></pre>
<p>Before we go further, please note the error checking of the 
command line arguments - an important rule to remember is
that YOU CANNOT TRUST INPUT VALUES. I'll say that again:
YOU CANNOT TRUST INPUT VALUES!!
Note also that we call the <code>free()</code> function to 
release the memory allocated by <code>malloc()</code> as we go.
If we handn't checked the inputs, and hadn't made 
that call to <code>free()</code> then our little test tool
could someday be turned into a pretty fine denial-of-service
attack vector. And while it might seem unlikely that 
that could happen, it might, say if someone decided to
make a web-enabled version of this available for some
reason, or if this kind of test was built into some
nightly build environment that could be triggered
remotely (e.g. via a git commit to a repo).</p>
<p>The lesson (and it's a very very important lesson) is
to always be cautious in coding, even if it seems that
there's no need today. Your code may be re-used years
later in ways and in an environment you never considered
and would think crazy!</p>
<p>Now we compile that using <code>make</code> and our executable
file is now <code>broken-malloc</code> instead of <code>a.out</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    $ make 
    gcc     broken-malloc.c broken-malloc.h   -o broken-malloc
    $ ./broken-malloc 
    Malloc 1 succeeded!
    Malloc 2 failed!
    Malloc 3 succeeded!
    Malloc 4 succeeded!
    Malloc 5 failed!
    Malloc 6 succeeded!
    Malloc 7 failed!
    Malloc 8 succeeded!
    Malloc 9 succeeded!
    Malloc 10 failed!
    Tests: 10, fails: 4
</code></pre>
<p>Or we can run it just 5 times:</p>
<pre><code>    $ ./broken-malloc 5
    Malloc 1 succeeded!
    Malloc 2 failed!
    Malloc 3 succeeded!
    Malloc 4 succeeded!
    Malloc 5 failed!
    Tests: 5, fails: 2
</code></pre>
<p>Do you notice anything in the above outputs?</p>
<hr />
<h2>Random but repeatable...</h2>
<p>Recall our fun LOC:</p>
<pre><code>    #define malloc(__xxx__) (rand()%100&lt;=30?0:malloc((__xxx__)))
</code></pre>
<p>With the above LOC, we didn't make any call to <code>srand()</code> so the
PRNG is always initialised in the same way, and hence always produces
the same set of random numbers, and hence our pattern of success/fail
for <code>malloc()</code> calls will be the same, every time we run <code>broken-malloc</code>.</p>
<p>That might sound bad, but can be useful - when testing it is good to
get the same result from two iterations of the same test, so you
can debug things more easily. OTOH, sometimes we'd like to have 
different things happen in each test, so this is a fine thing to
instrument, so we can control whether tests are repeatable or
not.</p>
<p>So let's see what it'd look like if we have two variations of
the test, one repeatable and one that differs each time.
In doing this, we'll switch
from using <code>rand()</code> to using <code>random()</code> which has a
different initialisation method that fits better for the
hack we're after here. (That's because <code>initstate()</code>
returns a value we can use, whereas <code>srand()</code> has 
no return value.)</p>
<p>Here's a version of broken-malloc.h that does that for us:</p>
<pre><code>    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
    #include &lt;time.h&gt;

    // comment this out for non-repetitive behaviour
    //#define REPEAT

    // what percentage of mallocs should fail?
    #define PERCENTFAIL 30

    #ifdef REPEAT
        // repeating version, no PRNG initialisation, same each time
        #define malloc(__xxx__) (rand()%100&lt;=PERCENTFAIL?0:malloc((__xxx__)))
    #else
        // PRNG initialisation =&gt; different behaviour each time 
        char* __srand_inited__=NULL;
        char __srand_state__[100];
        #define malloc(__xxx__) (( \
            ( \
                (__srand_inited__==NULL) \
                ? \
                    __srand_inited__=initstate(time(NULL),__srand_state__,100) \
                :\
                    NULL \
            ), \
            random() \
            )%100&lt;=PERCENTFAIL?0:malloc((__xxx__)))

    #endif
</code></pre>
<p>Now when we run our tests we get variation in the behaviour:</p>
<pre><code>    $ ./broken-malloc 5
    Malloc 1 succeeded!
    Malloc 2 succeeded!
    Malloc 3 succeeded!
    Malloc 4 failed!
    Malloc 5 failed!

<h2>Lovely, so are we done?</h2>
<p>Well, not quite, if you look back to the <code>malloc()</code> man page, you'll
see there are related functions like <code>calloc()</code> that is a little
different, and we'd also like to catch those and make 'em randomly
fail, so we should add a bit more to our header file...</p>
<pre><code>    void *__vxx__;
    int __tsz__;
    #define calloc(__sz__,__n__) (  \
                (__tsz__=(__sz__)*(__n__))? \
                    ( (__vxx__=malloc(__tsz__)) ?  \
                        memset(__vxx__,__tsz__,0) \
                    : 0 ) \
                : 0)
</code></pre>
<p>There's also <code>realloc()</code> but I'll leave that one to you
as an exercise.</p>

<h2>What's in the Makefile?</h2>
<p>Here's the Makefile for all this:</p>
<pre><code>    # This is the Makefile for CS2014 bm example

    # markdown stuff
    MDCMD=markdown_py 
    # make sure -f is last
    MDOPTS=-f

    # debug version
    #CC=gcc -g

    # non-debug version
    CC=gcc

<h2>Warning!! broken-malloc.h is hacky!!</h2>
<p>You MUST NOT do things like broken-malloc.h in production code.
It's meant to only be used during testing.
That can be a bit tricky, as someone might compile their
code with that included and failures will then occur in the
real world, and not in a test harness, and that'd be bad.
It does illustrate some of the goodness and badness of
C coding though:-)</p>
<p>Can you say what you think is good/bad about broken-malloc.h?</p>
<p>In fact, broken-malloc.h is pretty 20-th Century
and there are better tools available these days
that we'll look at later in the course.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>We've skimmed over a good few things here but will
go into more of them in detail as the course
progresses. Those included:</p>
<ul>
<li>man pages</li>
<li>make and Makefile</li>
<li>Editing, compiling and running C programs</li>
<li><code>malloc()</code> and friends - a bit about memory handling</li>
<li><code>rand()</code> and friends - a bit about randomness</li>
<li><code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> - command line arguments</li>
<li>We should be PARANOID ABOUT INPUT VALUES!</li>
<li>Header files and macros (#define)</li>
<li>Breaking things in testing</li>
<li>Hacky code isn't <em>always</em> bad, but mostly is:-)</li>
</ul>
