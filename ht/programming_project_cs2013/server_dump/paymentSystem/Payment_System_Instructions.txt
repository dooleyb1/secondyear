Payment System Instructions:
-------------------------------------
1.	Linking Wallet with payment system:
-	Link wallet to remote blockchain node: Open a new terminal, cd to monero-v0.11.1.0/ and connect wallet by:
	./monero-wallet-rpc --wallet-file [WalletName] --disable-rpc-login --password "[Password]" --daemon-host af.node.moneroworld.com:18089 --rpc-bind-port 18082

2.	Running the payment system:
-	cd back into the SoftwareEngineeringProject directory (cd ..) and cd into the paymentSystem directory.
-	Run the program by:
node makePayments [pathToFile]	(To make payments)
Or
node makePayments help		(For help)

-	If the file can’t be found no transactions will be made.

Each week a new file will be placed in the directory “transactionFiles” containing the transaction file with the transactions that need to be made for that week. 
The transaction files will be named “transactions([date that file was added]).csv. This system will need to be executed once a week to pay websites.
