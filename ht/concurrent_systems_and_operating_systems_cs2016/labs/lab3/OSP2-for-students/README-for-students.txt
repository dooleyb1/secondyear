Instructions for Implementing Student Projects Outside of Classroom Setting
===========================================================================

These instructions are intended for those persons who have purchased a
copy of the book

  Introduction to Operating System Design and Implementation: The OSP 2 Approach
  by M. Kifer and S.A. Smolka
  Springer Verlag, ISBN 978-1-84628-842-5

and want to implement the OSP 2 projects outside of a classroom setting.

The "projects" directory contains a subdirectory for each of the seven OSP 2
projects plus a subdirectory called "parameters" that contains a number of
parameter files with which to test your project implementations.

The OSP 2 API, the use of the template files in the project directories,
the various ways to work with the simulator, testing, and related issues
are described in the book.  In a nutshell, each project directory contains
one or more .java files that contain the templates for the classes and
methods you are to implement as part of your project.  Your implementation
should follow the guidelines described in the book, and it must use the OSP 2
API described there.

When all requisite classes and methods are complete, you can start
testing your implementation.  The OSP 2 simulator will drives the testing
process and issues errors and warnings, if it finds problems.  Your job is
to understand what causes those problems and fix them.

NO HELP IS PROVIDED BY THE OSP 2 TEAM.  IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE
STUDENT TO TEACH HIM OR HERSELF THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE DESIGN OF
OPERATING SYSTEMS AND THE OSP 2 API.  THE STUDENT MUST ALSO BE ABLE TO ANALYZE
THE FEEDBACK PROVIDED BY THE OSP 2 SIMULATOR AND FIX THE IMPLEMENTATION ERRORS
REPORTED BY THE SIMULATOR.
